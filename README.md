This HTML webpage uses JavaScript to reproduce the eyes drawn in the Halloween special effect hardware/software that make some spooky eyes.
The originals use a small microprocessor to draw animated eyes to two small LCD panels. In this version both eyes are drawn to a screen - either PC webpage (Chrome, Firefox etc...) or a mobile phone using their browser.
It includes code to prevent the mobile phone from sleeping so it can be left alone all night.
